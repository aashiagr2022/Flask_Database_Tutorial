# Blood Donation Bootcamp
Created final course project tutorial for CS 2300 (Introduction to Databases) while working on Pythonâ€™s framework Flask to build a connection between Databases and MySQL

This is a database tutorial using Python's framework Flask and MySQL which describes an entire process of connecting database to a basic UI in front-end.
I have created a registration page for "Blood Donation Bootcamp". The registration page will allow users to enter their first name, last name, email and age. 
They can also login into the portal and modify/edit or delete their registration request. In this tutorial, we will first start with setting up the flask work environment and then setting up connections between flask database.

I have also professionally drafted the entire tutorial using Jupyter Notebook which could be found attached in the repository above.
